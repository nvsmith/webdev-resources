## 1 - Strategies for Problem Solving

### General Problem Solving Techniques

1. Always Have A Plan
2. Restate The Problem
3. Divide The Problem
4. Start With What You Know
5. Reduce The Problem
6. Look For Analogies

#### 1. Always Have A Plan

**This is the most important rule!**

-   Having a plan is always possible.
    -   Plans may require alteration or scrapping altogether, but you should always have one before you tackle a problem.
-   ✅ Planning allows you to set and reach smaller, immediate goals.
-   ❌ Without a plan, your only goal is to solve the whole problem.
-   The first step of every plan is: "Formally restate the problem."
    -   Once you do that, you've already accomplished your first objective!

#### 2. Restate The Problem

-   Before starting a climb, circle the hill and see if there's an easier way up.
-   Restatement confirms your understanding of the problem.

##### The Fox, the Goose, and the Corn

-   Think about the problem itself. It can be as productive, if not more, than thinking about the solution.
-   🫤 OK: List specific actions to take to solve the problem.
    1.  Carry the fox across the river.
    2.  Carry the goose across the river.
    3.  Carry the corn across the river.
-   ✅ Better: Paramatize (make generic) the operations.
    1. Row the boat across the shore.
    2. If the boat is empty, load an item from the shore.
    3. If the boat isn't empty, unload the item onto the shore.

#### 3. Divide The Problem

-   Dividing the problem into smaller chunks can lower difficulty by an order of magnitude!
    -   ✅ Sort files into 2 piles of A-M and N-Z, then alphabetizing.
    -   ❌ Alphabetize every file individually, one after another.

##### Sliding Tile Puzzles

-   Strategy > Trial & Error
    -   Working with a specific goal is always better than random effort.
-   Look for ways to divide the problem.
    -   Experiment with reduced versions of problem.

#### 4. Start With What You Know

-   Start with what you can do and work outward from there.
    -   Partial solutions often inspire solutions for other aspects of the problem.
-   Try to make repairs with your tools before going to the hardware store for new ones.

##### Sudoku

-   Constraints are your friend; look for the **most constrained variable**.
    -   They eliminate choices and simplify the possible solution.
-   **most constrained variable**: the variable that has the lowest number of possible values (the most restrictive consideration).
-   Start with what's obvious.
    -   If you can solve part of a problem, do it!

#### 5. Reduce The Problem

-   Stuck? Add or remove constraints until you know how to solve a particular condition.
-   Reducing problems allows you to pinpoint where remaining difficulty lies.

#### 6. Look For Analogies

-   Recognizing analogies is the most difficult skill because it requires experience and solutions to reference.

##### The Quarrasi Lock

-   This puzzle is analogous to the Fox, Goose, and Corn problem from earlier.
-   The sooner you make connections to analogies for which you already have solutions, the less work you'll have to do.

#### 7. Experiment

-   Experimentation ≠ Guessing
-   Hypothesize about what will happen and observe the results of your trial.

#### 8. Don't Get Frustrated

-   Frustration is an excuse to continue to fail.
    -   Take a real break and don't think about the problem.
    -   Focus your attention on another problem and return later.
-   Never forget the first rule: Always have a plan.
    -   If your original plan doesn't pan out, time to make another plan. And repeat.
