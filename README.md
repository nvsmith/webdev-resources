## About The Project

This is a documentation repository for my tech notes, templates, and other resources that I've accumulated and developed over the years as a web developer. It's like a one-stop-shop for all the tools and examples that I find myself continually reaching for when I'm building or troubleshooting a project.

<br>

## Usage

Documents will typically be written in Markdown. As such, they should be easily viewable in any web browser. To use/modify the documents, clone or download the document and open it in your text editor of choice.

<br>

## Roadmap

I intend to continually add to this project. However, there is no grand, 5-year plan here; I go where my curiosity takes me and add to my repository of knowledge as needed.
